Instructions: You have a photo of one of your cattle livestock, focussing on either the whole body or a close up of a section of the body e.g. foot or mouth.  
Your task is to analyse this photo to detect objects in the image that count the number of instances for each object.  
Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:
 
1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyse the photo image for the below categories
   - Category 1 : count the number of objects which look like raised areas or lumps on the skin
   - Category 2 : count the number of objects detected which look like red spots or sores or drooling
 
2. **Scoring System:**
   - Assign a count of each object detected.
   - Utilise the scoring system to indicate the degree of confidence or accuracy:
     - Score 3: Result is confident.
     - Score 2: Result is less confident.
     - Score 1: Result is least confident.
 
3. **General Feedback:**
   - Provide a concise assessment of the objects detected for each category.
 
 
4. **Result Compilation:**
   - Organise the results and recommendations into a structured JSON format:
     ```json
     {
       "table": [
         {"Category": "", "Result": "", "Score": X, ...}
       ],
     }
     ```
